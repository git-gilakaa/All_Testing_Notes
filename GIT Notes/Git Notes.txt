1 - Git Upload: First-Time Setup & Push
=======================================

Step 1: Initialize Git in your project folder
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal
- Navigate to your project path:
  cd path/to/your/project
- Run:
  git init
  → This initializes a new Git repository in the current folder.

Step 2: Connect to your GitHub repository
- Run:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  → This links your local project to the remote GitHub repository.

Step 3: Stage all files for commit
- Run:
  git add .
  → This adds all files in the folder to Git's staging area.

Step 4: Commit your changes
- Run:
  git commit -m "Initial commit - project upload"
  → This saves your staged changes with a message.

Step 5: Push files to GitHub
- Run:
  git push -u origin main
  → This pushes your code to the 'main' branch of the remote repo.
  → If your repo uses 'master', replace 'main' with 'master'.

Done! Your project is now live on GitHub.

2 - Git Upload: Merging Local Branch to Master
==============================================

Step 1: Confirm you're in your local branch
- Run:
  git branch
  → Shows all branches. The current branch is marked with an asterisk (*).

Step 2: Stage and commit your changes
- Run:
  git add .
  → Stages all modified and new files.

- Run:
  git commit -m "Your commit message here"
  → Saves the staged changes to your local branch.

Step 3: Push your local branch to GitHub (optional but recommended)
- Run:
  git push origin your-local-branch-name
  → Example: git push origin GIT_NOTES

Step 4: Switch to the master branch
- Run:
  git checkout master
  → Switches you to the master branch.

Step 5: Merge your local branch into master
- Run:
  git merge your-local-branch-name
  → Example: git merge GIT_NOTES

Step 6: Push the updated master branch to GitHub
- Run:
  git push origin master
  → Uploads the merged changes to the master branch on GitHub.


3 - Git Merge Conflict: Understanding and Resolving
===================================================

- I am in the master branch and I made 3 commits: C1 → C2 → C3
- Then I created a dev branch, checked out to dev, and made some changes
- I did not make any changes on the master branch
- Then I merged both branches

✅ No merge conflicts occurred because changes were made only in one direction (dev branch only)

❗ If I make changes to the same file in both master and dev branches, and then try to merge, I may get merge conflicts

Common Reasons for Merge Conflicts:
-----------------------------------
1. Both branches changed the same lines in a file
2. One branch renamed or moved a file, while the other branch edited it
3. One branch deleted a file, while the other branch modified it


Examples to understand:
======================

- I am in the master branch and created a file named 'File1' with one line of data
- I committed it as: "master C1"

- Then I created a new branch 'dev' and checked out to dev
- I edited the line in 'File1' and committed it as: "dev C1"

- We can check the commit history using:
  git log --oneline

- Now, if we merge 'dev' into 'master', we won't get conflicts because no changes were made on master (this is a one-way flow)

- Now I check out to 'master' and make some changes in the same file ('File1')
- Then I try to merge 'dev' into 'master' — ❗ Now I will get conflicts because both branches changed the same file

Conflict Resolution Options:
============================

1. Accept Current Change
→ Keeps the version of the file from your current branch  
→ Example: If you're on master, it keeps master’s version

2. Accept Incoming Change
→ Keeps the version coming from the branch you're merging  
→ Example: If you're merging dev into master, it keeps dev’s version

3. Accept Both Changes
→ Keeps both versions in the file — one after the other  
→ You may need to manually clean or adjust the result

4. Compare Changes
→ Opens a side-by-side view to help you see the difference  
→ Useful for deciding which version to keep

How to Resolve a Merge Conflict:
================================
Step 1: Git will show the conflict in the file

Step 2: Open the file and look for conflict markers like:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Your current branch content
=======
Incoming branch content
>>>>>>> dev

Step 3: Edit the file manually to keep the correct version

Step 4: Save the file

Step 5: Run:
  git add filename
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

Step 6: Push the changes to GitHub
  git push origin master
