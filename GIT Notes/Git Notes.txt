Git Upload: First-Time Setup & Push
===================================

Step 1: Initialize Git in your project folder
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal
- Navigate to your project path:
  cd path/to/your/project
- Run:
  git init
  → This initializes a new Git repository in the current folder.

Step 2: Connect to your GitHub repository
- Run:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  → This links your local project to the remote GitHub repository.

Step 3: Stage all files for commit
- Run:
  git add .
  → This adds all files in the folder to Git's staging area.

Step 4: Commit your changes
- Run:
  git commit -m "Initial commit - project upload"
  → This saves your staged changes with a message.

Step 5: Push files to GitHub
- Run:
  git push -u origin main
  → This pushes your code to the 'main' branch of the remote repo.
  → If your repo uses 'master', replace 'main' with 'master'.

Done! Your project is now live on GitHub.

Git Upload: Merging Local Branch to Master
==========================================

Step 1: Confirm you're in your local branch
- Run:
  git branch
  → Shows all branches. The current branch is marked with an asterisk (*).

Step 2: Stage and commit your changes
- Run:
  git add .
  → Stages all modified and new files.

- Run:
  git commit -m "Your commit message here"
  → Saves the staged changes to your local branch.

Step 3: Push your local branch to GitHub (optional but recommended)
- Run:
  git push origin your-local-branch-name
  → Example: git push origin GIT_NOTES

Step 4: Switch to the master branch
- Run:
  git checkout master
  → Switches you to the master branch.

Step 5: Merge your local branch into master
- Run:
  git merge your-local-branch-name
  → Example: git merge GIT_NOTES

Step 6: Push the updated master branch to GitHub
- Run:
  git push origin master
  → Uploads the merged changes to the master branch on GitHub.
