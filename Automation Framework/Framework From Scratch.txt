   - Wireframes, screen maps, element naming guidelines.

10) API Details (if hybrid framework)
   - Swagger or OpenAPI docs, endpoint list, payload samples.

11) Existing Test Cases
   - Manual test cases, high-priority scenarios.

   - Data reset process, seed data, masking rules for sensitive data.

13) Browser / Device Matrix
   - List of browsers, versions, devices that need testing.

14) Source Control Details
   - Git repository access, branching model.

15) CI/CD Details
   - Jenkins or GitHub Actions setup, agents, secrets management.

16) Reporting Expectations
   - Extent/Allure report, email or Slack notification.

17) Defect Process
   - Tool (Jira, Azure), severity levels, logging rules.

18) Security / Compliance
   - Rules about handling credentials and PII.

19) Definition of Done
   - What is considered done for framework delivery?
   - Example: Smoke suite running in CI with reports.

20) Roles & Responsibilities
   - Who reviews code, approves merges, maintains test data.

=================================================================
B) DOCUMENTS TO COLLECT FROM CLIENT
-----------------------------------
- BRD/FRD or user stories with acceptance criteria.
- Wireframes / screen maps.
- API specification (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Test environment URLs and access instructions.
- Test accounts with roles and permissions.
- Browser/device support list.
- Existing manual test cases.
- Test data rules (masking, reset, seeding).
- CI/CD setup details (tool, agent OS, vault).
- Security/compliance guidelines.

=================================================================
C) DOCUMENTS YOU DELIVER BACK TO CLIENT
---------------------------------------
1) Test Strategy
   - Scope, in-scope/out-of-scope, smoke/regression tags.

2) Automation Design Document
   - Architecture: POM + PageFactory + TestNG + Cucumber.
   - Driver management, waits, retries, reporting.

3) Coding Standards Guide
   - Naming rules, PageObject structure, locator strategy.

4) Environment & Config Guide
   - config.properties usage, environment switching.

5) Runbook / CI Guide
   - How to run locally, in Jenkins, scheduling runs.

6) Reporting Guide
   - Extent/Allure reports, screenshots, logs.

7) Traceability Matrix (optional)
   - Story → Scenario → Test → Report.

8) Onboarding README
   - 10-minute setup, prerequisites, common issues.

=================================================================
D) FRAMEWORK BUILD STEPS
------------------------
1) Setup Project
   - Create Maven project, add dependencies:
     Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Extent Reports, WebDriver Manager.

2) Create Base Structure
   - src/test/java
       - base (DriverManager, TestBase)
       - pages (PageObjects using PageFactory)
       - tests (TestNG/Cucumber test classes)
       - utils (WaitUtils, ScreenshotUtils, Logger)
       - reports (Extent setup)
       - features (Cucumber .feature files)
       - stepdefinitions (Cucumber StepDefs)

3) Config Management
   - Add config.properties (URL, browser, timeout).
   - Create ConfigReader utility.

4) Driver Setup
   - Use WebDriverManager to handle drivers.
   - Implement ThreadLocal WebDriver for parallel tests.

5) Page Object Model with PageFactory
   - Each page has its own class.
   - Define @FindBy locators and methods.

6) TestNG + Cucumber Setup
   - Write feature files (Given/When/Then).
   - Map Step Definitions to PageObjects.
   - Create TestNG runner class.

7) Screenshot Utility
   - Capture screenshots on failure.
   - Add code in Listener (ITestListener) + attach to report.

8) Extent Reports
   - Initialize report in BeforeSuite.
   - Log pass/fail/skip with screenshots.

9) Retry Analyzer
   - Implement IRetryAnalyzer for rerunning failed tests.

10) Parallel Execution
   - Configure testng.xml for parallel=“methods”.
   - Ensure DriverManager is thread-safe.

11) Jenkins CI/CD Integration
   - Create Jenkins pipeline.
   - Pull code from Git, run tests, generate reports.
   - Send email/Slack notification with report.

=================================================================
E) BENEFITS OF THIS FRAMEWORK
------------------------------
- Reusable PageObjects (clean separation of logic).
- Centralized config and utilities.
- Automatic screenshots on failure.
- Extent/Allure reports with detailed results.
- Parallel + cross-browser execution.
- CI/CD ready (nightly regression, smoke on PR).
- Easy onboarding with README and setup guide.
- Scalable for future modules.

=================================================================
F) SAMPLE CLIENT KICKOFF QUESTIONS
----------------------------------
1) Which modules are top priority for automation?
2) What environment should we run nightly (QA/Stage)?
3) Provide 3 test accounts (admin, user, guest).
4) Any OTP/2FA bypass for test environment?
5) Which Git repo should we use?
6) CI tool details (Jenkins/GitHub Actions).
7) Who should receive test reports (email/Slack)?
8) Any PII/security constraints for logs and screenshots?
9) Browser/device list for initial scope?
10) Definition of Done for framework (Smoke in CI with reports)?

=================================================================
SUMMARY
-------
1) Collect client inputs (scope, env, accounts, test cases, browsers).
2) Collect documents (BRD, wireframes, APIs, data rules).
3) Deliver automation documents (Strategy, Design, Runbook).
4) Build framework step by step (POM + PageFactory + TestNG + Cucumber).
5) Add utilities (screenshots, waits, logger, retries).
6) Add reporting (Extent).
7) Integrate CI/CD (Jenkins).
8) Run Smoke on PR, Regression nightly.
9) Deliver reports + traceability + demo.
10) Framework is now scalable and client-ready.
